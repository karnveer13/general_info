Many ways present on Internet to setup and make vim tool more richer and more use friendly
manually can also be done and many developers can use different pluging managers, some of them are as follows

(vim-plug)plug.vim
vundle
pathogen

Lets look at how to setup plug.vim, it is bit easier than others 

Step 1:
======= 
create below directory at home path (i.e. for # user home directoy could be /(root))
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload >> once verify 
cd ~/.vim/autoload#
pwd
/root/.vim/autoload

now download plug.vim file and place it inside /root/.vim/autoload

####### more directory option can also be added as below
autoload
colors
plugged
backup

currently we are focused on auoload and plugged(plugin) folder

Step 2: 
=======

create .vimrc file inside the ~/.vimrc (like this if you don't have same file already) and below content in the file 
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
add multiple plugins here
" Make sure you use single quotes
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
more plug here
more plug here
more plug here
..............
call plug#end()
and save the .vimrc file with above content

Step 3: 
======= 
now simply run vim command and goto command mode (SHIFT+:) and typebelow
:PlugInstall (to install Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree' as entry present inside .vimrc file) you must visible Progress bar at top-left corner
of your window

Now open vim <filepath>
(SHIFT+:):NERDTree in the vim command mode

Step 4:
======= 
Plugins can also be activated by pressing the keyboard keys when on VIM editior 
first please check key-notation and mapping by pressing below command in vim editior
:help key-notation

And below are mode present in VIM editior
:nmap - display normal mode maps (nnoremap)
:imap - display insert mode maps
:vmap - display visual and select mode maps
:smap - display select mode maps
:xmap - display visual mode maps
:cmap - display command-line mode maps
:omap - display operator pending mode maps

To map key-board shortcuts to vim editior
Key mapping syntax is like this:
map_mode <what_you_type> <what_is_executed>

Now to make keyboard key permanent mapping use nnoremap command(NORMAL mode) inside the vimrc file as follows
:nnoremap <C-g> :NERDTree<CR>

and to unmap use below
nunmap <C-g>
